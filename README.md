<h1>Windows Server</h1>
Imagine this scenario: you are using the CorpFiles16 server as a file server. You can do basic file server management for network users, but you need to be able to perform the following file server management tasks:

- Define policies that prevent users from saving .wmv files in the home folders stored on the server.
- Share files with UNIX-based clients.

In this walkthrough, we'll perform the following file server management tasks

- Add the File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) role service, which allows you to configure file screens to prevent users from saving specific file types in a specific folder
- Add the Server for NFS role service to be able to share files with UNIX-based clients.


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Computer with Internet Connection
- Microsoft Azure
- Microsoft virtual machine
- Microsoft Windows Server 2012 Datacenter 

<h2>Program Walk-Through:</h2>


<h3>Step 1: Create an Azure Account</h3>


Create an Azure account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
- Select Start Free
- Follow the prompt to create the account 
     - You will need to put in your credit card information, but you will get $200 worth of Azure credit and will have 30 days to use those credits. You will not be charged until then
- Finish the prompt, click Go to Azure Portal, and you are ready to start with Azure!
     - You may also go to [portal.azure.com](https://www.portal.azure.com) to start

</p>


<h3>Step 2: Create a Resource Group</h3>

- Go to the search bar at the top and search "resource group"
- Select Create Resource Group
- You will need to name the resource group and select the region 
- Select Review + Create on the lower left
    - For this example, we will be using RG-Lab-1 for the name and (US) West 3 for the region

</p>

<h3>Step 3: Create a Storage Account</h3>

- Go to the search bar and search "storage account"
- Select Create Storage Account
- You will need to select the same resource group, the same region, and create a name for the storage group
    - For this example, we will name the storage group "rglab1"
    - Use the same resource group and region as step 2
- Select Review, then Create

</p>


<h3>Step 4: Create a Virtual Machine</h3>
     
- Go to the search bar and search "virtual machine"
- Select Create, then select Azure Virtual Machine
- You will need to select the same resource group, the same region, and create a name for the virtual machine
    - For thise example, we will name the virtual machine "virtualmachine"
    - Use the same resource group and region as steps 2 and 3

* You will then need to select the image and disk size
    - For image we will use Windows 10 Pro
    - For size, select See All Sizes and select Standard D2as_v4
* You will then need to make a username and password
    - For username, we will use "labuser"
    - Create your own password
* Click the box under licensing and finally click Review + Create

</p>
 
     

<h3>Step 5: Connect to the Virtual Machine</h3>

- First, you will need to find the public IP address of your virtual machine
   - Select the virtual machine we created and the public IP address will be on the right-hand side of the screen
   - Copy the public IP address

* Mac Users 
   - Download Microsoft Remote Desktop
   - Open the application and click Add PC
   - Paste the public IP address and select Add
   - Double-click on the virtual machine and enter the username and password from step 4
   - Select Continue
   
* Windows Users
     - Open and use Remote Desktop
     - Paste the public IP Address and select Connect
     - Enter the username and password from step 4

     -  A word of advice: if you’re going to turn this option on, make sure you do it after hours when nobody is using the server. For example, someone might have a file open on the server that they’re actively editing. Suppose we turn the option on to automatically restart the server after the roles have been installed. In that case, we will break the connection between the workstation and the server. Somebody will lose their work, especially if they forgot to save it.
