<h1>Microsoft Server</h1>
Imagine this scenario: you are using the CorpFiles16 server as a file server. You can do basic file server management for network users, but you need to be able to perform the following file server management tasks:

- Define policies that prevent users from saving .wmv files in the home folders stored on the server.
- Share files with UNIX-based clients.

In this scenario, your task is to perform the following:

- Add the File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) role service, which allows you to configure file screens to prevent users from saving specific file types in specific folders.
- Add the Server for NFS role service to be able to share files with UNIX-based clients.

<h3>Tip</h3>

-  In case you need to restart the server after finishing the installation, check the box on the Confirmation screen that says "Restart the destination server automatically if required." As a warning, the server will restart after isntallation without further warning, so ensure no files or services are being remotely accessed at the tim eof the restart, otherwise the person working on th eremote file will lose server connectivity--and possibly lose any cahgnes they made to the document.
